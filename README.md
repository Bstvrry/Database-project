PROJECT IDEA DEFINTION: TREE PLANTING AND REFORESTATION DATABASE
Deforestation, environmental degradation and climate change are significant challenges that not only Kenya but also the world faces today. In recent decades, Kenya has experienced deforestation due to agricultural expansion, urbanization and illegal logging. These activities have led to the loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, increased soil pH and increased carbon emissions contributing to adverse climate change impacts. To turn around the situation, the Kenyan government has taken the initiative of tree planting and reforestation but tracking these initiatives has been inefficient. 

For these tree planting initiatives, what they lack is proper data management in that a manual filing system maybe used to store records and lack of accountability in that nobody can follow on a singular project and the inability to measure true ecological impact on local ecosystems. Without a centralized way of data management, it is challenging to reverse the climatic damage. 

 Thus, our tree planting and reforestation database is a database that monitors and tracks tree planting and reforestation initiatives. The database mainly stores data on various projects, such as species planted, geographical locations, survival rates, growth progress and the impact on the local ecosystems. It is therefore a centralized system designed to manage, monitor and track tree planting initiatives. In addition, the database will serve as a tool to analyse reforestation efforts, provide insights into ecosystem recovery and track carbon reduction efforts over time.  

The database aligns primarily with SDG 13 on climate action and SDG 15 on Life on Land. The reforestation database supports SDG 13 by tracking carbon sequestration and promoting climate resilience, while aligning with SDG 15 by enabling sustainable land management, biodiversity conservation, and combating desertification. It centralizes data on reforestation efforts, helping measure ecological benefits and progress toward reversing climate damage. 

SCOPE 

The database will be able to provide information about the tree species planted in an area, as well as their benefits, requirements and characteristics. Project data will also be considered providing location of a project, tree species planted and number of trees. Species data about trees planted will be noted showing the growth rate and native area of the particular species. The impact on local ecosystems will also be covered, noting how soil erosion and pH improves and howw biodiversity is restored.Growth rate of trees will be tracked to note which tree species do well in what climate. Volunteer management will be included. Thus the centralized system will serve as a vital tool for analyzing ecological impacts, guiding future initiatives, and advancing global sustainability goals.
